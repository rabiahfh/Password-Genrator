#                                               Password-Generator
This is my project where I created functionality, using javascript, for a password generator that I was given the html for. First the password generators javascript entailed named variables that contained arrays used to narrow down the criteria wanted by the users and declare variable that were also used for the password once generated.  Next a function containing a for loop and various other DOM elements used to direct the computer through the criteria selected by the user. Lastly it also gave functionality to actually display the password.
